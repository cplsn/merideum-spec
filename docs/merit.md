# Merit
Merit is a programming language that comes bundled with a Merideum implementation. 
Merideum uses Merit for request syntax and execution. 
The language is designed to be simple, concise, and familiar.
Merit is intentionally unadvanced--this is to prevent misuse or abuse and keep requests/contracts from becoming too complex.
Merit implementations may differ, but the behavior of the language must remain the same.
